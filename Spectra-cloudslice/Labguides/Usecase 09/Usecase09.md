# Use case 9 - Implement end to end agent operations for Zava’s shopping assistant in Microsoft Foundry

**Introduction**

This lab demonstrates how to implement **end-to-end agent operations**
using Azure AI Foundry by building an intelligent retail assistant named
**Cora** for Zava, a home improvement retailer. It walks through the
complete lifecycle of an AI solution—from provisioning Azure resources
and deploying applications to building, orchestrating, and evaluating AI
agents.

You will gain hands-on experience with Azure services such as **Azure AI
Search, Azure AI Agent Service, and model evaluation tools**, enabling
you to design scalable, intelligent, and production-ready AI
applications.

**Scenario**

Zava is a fictional retail company that sells home improvement products
such as paints, tools, and hardware. To enhance customer experience,
Zava introduces **Cora**, an AI-powered shopping assistant.

Cora helps customers:

- Discover suitable products for their needs

- Compare prices and availability

- Get personalized recommendations (e.g., eco-friendly options)

- Answer product-related queries

As Zava grows, Cora evolves from a **single-agent system** into a
**multi-agent architecture**, incorporating specialized agents like:

- Product Inventory Agent

- Customer Service Agent

Additionally, the solution includes **evaluation pipelines** to ensure
accuracy, quality, and safety before deployment.

**Objectives**

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Register required Azure resource providers and set up the environment

- Deploy an AI-powered application using Azure and GitHub Codespaces

- Configure Azure AI Search and create a product index

- Build and interact with a retail AI agent (Cora)

- Implement vector search for product retrieval

- Develop a **multi-agent system** for advanced use cases

- Generate synthetic datasets for testing and evaluation

- Evaluate AI models for performance, quality, and safety

- Apply **GenAIOps practices** for reliable and secure AI deployment

## Task 14: Cora-For-Zava: Exploring AI Safety Evaluators for Secure Responses

**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious
retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. Before deploying
Cora to serve Zava customers, you must ensure it generates safe,
appropriate content and is protected against adversarial attacks. This
notebook guides you through Azure AI Foundry's safety evaluators,
helping you identify and mitigate risks like harmful content, jailbreak
attempts, and protected material violations to maintain a secure and
trustworthy customer experience.

1.  Navigate to the **labs/** **4-evaluation/** folder and open the
    **43-evaluate-safety.ipynb** notebook to begin the environment setup
    lab.

2.  Click **Select Kernel**, then choose the **Python 3.12.11**
    environment to run the Lab 02 notebook

**Summary**

In this lab, you implemented a complete **end-to-end AI solution** for a
retail assistant using Azure AI Foundry. Starting from environment setup
and deployment, you built Cora, enhanced it with search capabilities,
and evolved it into a multi-agent system.

You also explored critical aspects of production AI systems, including:

- Data indexing and retrieval

- Agent orchestration

- Model evaluation and selection

- Safety and quality validation

By the end of this exercise, you gained practical experience in
designing, deploying, and managing **scalable, intelligent AI
applications** that deliver real-world business value.
